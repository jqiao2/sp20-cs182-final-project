This is our code for the CS182 Computer Vision project using PyTorch 1.5.0. It contains the following files:

README.txt - This file
requirements.txt - The python requirements necessary to run this code
test_submission.py - A sample file which will return an ouput for every input in the eval.csv.
		     It also contains the definition of our model, an EfficientNet.
best.ckpt - A PyTorch checkpoint file that contains the weights of the best model we trained

We have only tested this code using Python 3. It may or may not be Python 2 compatible.
